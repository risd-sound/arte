# ARTE Media Art Workshop

Workshop code for ARTE workshop: Sonic Interaction and Experience, August 9, 2017

Workshop Description:
Shawn Greenlee (Associate Professor, RISD) will lead a workshop on designing sound-based interactions and experiences with the programming language Pure Data (Pd).  Shawn will provide an introduction to Pure Data, an open source language suitable for students new to programming.  The workshop focus will be on the development of a project for mobile devices, incorporating on-screen interaction and data from onboard sensors. Topics covered will include sound synthesis and sampling, audio signal processing, and auditory display.

**For today's session:**

1. You'll need a laptop computer, a mobile device (iOS or Android), a USB sync cable, and headphones/earbuds.
2. Download and install Pd 0.47-1 (Pure Data) from <a href="http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html" target="_blank">http://msp.ucsd.edu/software.html</a>.  For Mac the version to get is: **Pd version 0.47-1 compiled for Macintosh OSX 10.4 or later (6 Megabytes)**, then put in your Applications folder.  For Windows, the version to get is: **Pd version 0.47-1 compiled for Microsoft Windows (installer) (executable; 8 Megabytes)**.
3. Download MobMuPlat development package: <a href="http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/" target="_blank">http://danieliglesia.com/mobmuplat/</a>. Make a new working folder on your Desktop and move the MobMuPlat package there (get it out of your Downloads folder).  
4. If you have a Windows computer, you'll need Java installed for the MobMuPlat editor to work.  Please see: https://java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml
5. For your mobile device, download MobMuPlat either from <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/kr/app/mobmuplat/id597679399?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes store (iOS)</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iglesiaintermedia.mobmuplat" target="_blank">Google Play store (Android)</a>.  It's a free app.
6. For iOS, you'll need iTunes.  For Mac + Android, you can use Android file transfer:  <a href="https://www.android.com/filetransfer/" target="_blank">https://www.android.com/filetransfer/</a>  
6. You'll need the appropriate sync cable for your device.  Alternatively you can transfer files via AirDrop (iOS), e-mail, or file-sharing apps (like Dropbox or Google Drive).
7. If you have Windows + Android, file transfer should be fairly straightforward with Windows Explorer (we'll figure it out).
